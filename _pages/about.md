Hi, my name is August and I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Biomedical Engineering Department]("https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/biomedical-engineering") at OHSU. My research, mentored by [Daniel M. Zuckerman]("https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/zuckerman-lab"), focuses on developing methods to study the mechanisms of molecular machines such as pumps or motors.
