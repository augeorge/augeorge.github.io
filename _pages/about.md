My name is August and I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Biomedical Engineering Department](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/biomedical-engineering) at Oregon Health and Science University. My research, mentored by [Daniel M. Zuckerman](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/zuckerman-lab), focuses on developing quantitative methods to study the mechanisms of nano-scale machines such as molecular pumps and motors. Broadly speaking, I am interested in integrating physics-based modeling with data-driven processes - with an emphasis on biomedical applications.

Prior to starting my PhD I worked as an equipment technician in the R&D division at [Intel Corp](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html). There I assisted with routine maintenance, troubleshooting, team leadership, and process development for [Hitachi](https://www.hitachi-hightech.com/us/) plasma etching systems. 

Before that I completed my Bachelor's degree in physics from the [Honors College](https://www.pdx.edu/honors/) at Portland State University. My undergraduate thesis, ["MOSCAP Oxide Charges"](https://doi.org/10.15760/honors.189), was supervised by [Rajendra Solanki](https://www.pdx.edu/physics/profile/raj-solanki) and investigated the effects of MOSCap oxide charges on device performance and the semiconductor manufacturing process. 

My hobbies outside of academic research include: music, art, food, programming, 
and all things sci-fi - MTFBWY!
