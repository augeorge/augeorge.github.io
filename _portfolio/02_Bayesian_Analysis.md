This project contains a Jupyter notebook on Bayesian analysis - prepared for a guest lecture in a graduate 'quantitative biology methods' course. 
The notebook focuses primarily on the following: given a noisy dataset for a linear model, how can we use Bayesian inference to determine a distribution
of model parameters (e.g. slope, intercept, noise variance)?
