This project (in development) aims to improve on the original [ModelExplorer](https://github.com/ZuckermanLab/ModelExplorer) project by porting from Perl to Python 3.x 
and adding new functionality, including data-driven Bayesian analysis. The goal is to develop a robust pipeline to infer molecular machine mechanisms 
from experimental data.
